The article provides a bigger picture story, analyzing the potential impact of the settlement on Goldman Sachs' earnings and comparing it to the performance of other banks in the industry. This angle is distinct from the original press release, which simply announced the settlement and its terms.\"\n",
    "Your response: \n",
    "\"Big Picture\": This angle zooms out and looks at the news event in a broader context, by viewing several banks at the same time. It aims to describe a larger phenomenon.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "Angle: \"This news article takes a unique angle by using the Goldman Sachs settlement as a springboard to explore the broader theme of the \"establishment\" and its perceived corruption, cronyism, and influence peddling in Washington and on Wall Street. The article weaves together various narratives, including the 2016 presidential election, the revolving door between government and finance, and the perceived disconnect between the powerful elite and ordinary Americans. This angle contrasts with the original press release, which simply reported on the settlement agreement between Goldman Sachs and the government. The article\\'s focus on the larger cultural and societal implications of the settlement adds depth and context to the story, making it a more nuanced and thought-provoking piece.\"\n",

    "Angle: \"The unique angle of this news article is that it provides a more in-depth analysis of the settlement and its implications, rather than just reporting the facts of the agreement. The article also provides context about the background of the case, mentioning the financial crisis and the collapse of the US housing market, and highlights the impact of the settlement on Goldman Sachs' earnings. Additionally, the article mentions the decline in Goldman Sachs' profit in the third quarter of 2015, which is not mentioned in the original press release. Overall, the article takes a more narrative approach, trying to tell a story around the settlement rather than just reporting the facts.\"\n",
