0,www.sempra.com/socalgas-seeks-offer-renewable-natural-gas-customers,"SoCalGas has proposed a program to offer customers the option to purchase renewable natural gas, a carbon-neutral or carbon-negative fuel produced from waste and agriculture, to heat homes and businesses, cook, and fuel vehicles. The program aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for renewable natural gas, with the goal of increasing supply and lowering costs over time. If approved, the program would allow customers to choose from various options to purchase renewable natural gas, with the fuel being blended into the existing pipeline system. The proposal has received support from environmental groups, businesses, and universities, and is expected to be available to nearly all SoCalGas core residential and small commercial and industrial customers if approved by regulators.",www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/2/14/21131109/california-natural-gas-renewable-socalgas,"The unique angle this news article takes on the press release is a critical analysis of the concept of ""renewable natural gas"" (RNG) and its potential to decarbonize the natural gas system. The article argues that RNG is not a viable alternative to electrification and that the natural gas industry is using it as a desperate bid to delay its inevitable decline.
