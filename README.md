# conditional-information-retrieval

This is the repository for the `conditional information retrieval` summer project.

Please see `notebooks/2024-05-28__demo.ipynb` for a demo on how to download the data.

`sample_prompts.py` will give you a sense of some of the prompts I have tried already for a LLM-oriented approach to this problem. 

Pay special attention to the prompts related to source-suggestions.
