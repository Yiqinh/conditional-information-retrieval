The results showed more than half of those working for large food or retail chains had schedules that varied or rotated. The average worker told the researchers work schedules could fluctuate by 11 hours from one week to the next. Further, 38 percent of workers reported their income changed week to week; 22 percent said that they had difficulty paying bills as a result. Clopening, or closing one night and opening the next day, was worked by almost four in 10 respondents. About 70 percent of part-time workers said they wanted more hours. A quarter of the workers said they received less than a week's notice of scheduling, and 21 percent worked on call. On-call practices are often an offshoot of companies' just-in-time labor practices, powered by software scheduling analytics to avoid having too many workers during slow periods. Seven in 10 said they struggled with caregiving issues in their families as a result of their employer's short-notice scheduling. 28 percent of service sector workers claimed a regular daytime work schedule.
